# Recipes Web Application
It's a simple web application that I've created while learing Spring MVC.


Application allows registered users to create accounts and post their recipes online.

Unregistered users can only view recipes and use implemented 'find recipe' funcionality.

Administrators can perform some of the CRUD operations on users and also manage 'Categories' and 'Unit of measures'
